This is a utility written in Clojure which allows the programmer to create an audio deck object which can hold a list of audio clips. The deck object has commands for basic playlist controls (play, pause, next, etc.).

NOTE: This is a work in progress. The only way to use this is to load it while running a REPL. I am currently working on making this into a library.
